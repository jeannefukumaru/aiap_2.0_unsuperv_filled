    "This week's assignment consists of two parts. The first part gives you an introduction to unsupervised learning. In particular, we focus on techniques for clustering and dimensionality reduction and how they can be applied to ecommerce data. As you work through the three clustering case studies, you will find yourself generating many intermediate datasets, trying different models, and tuning each model as you go along. There's a lot to keep track of.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Part 2 comes in. It is in Part 2 that we introduce ideas of **workflow management** and **computational reproducibility**. Workflow management means organising your project directory to manage your analysis' artefacts (visualisations, processed datasets, notebooks and utility functions and experiment results). Ideally, your code for these should be clearly commented with well chosen names. Computational reproducibility means someone else (including future you!) being able to take just the code and data, and reproduce your project, from its results and models to visualisations etc. How one decides to practice workflow management and computational reproducibility can be quite a personal decision. Therefore, we provide guidelines, not rules. The most important is having a system rather than no system at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "**note about the week**   \n",
    "While week 1's assignment was guided, with specific instructions about what code to run, as we move on the assignments will involve less hand-holding. For this week, we include some instructions, but leave the specific implementations up to you. There are also many techniques we cover. Again, while we share some resources, we leave the bulk of the research and background reading up to you to manage for yourself. As a record of how well you have synthesised your readings, this notebook has space for writing a few paragraphs of explanations. We hope you won't be content with a shallow explanation, and that you use this space to apply the [Feynmann technique](https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/) as a check of understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "To tie Part 1 and Part 2 of the week together, we are not just asking for one Jupyter Notebook as a final deliverable. Instead, there are four deliverables to the week: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Part 1 Notebook I and II exercises presented at the end of the week job-interview style**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. A script that automates the data cleaning and feature engineering steps you take so your findings are reproducible (see Part 2 Notebook I for more info)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. A repo README.md (see Part 2 Notebook I for more info)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4  A record of software package versions and software environment used (see Part 2 Notebook I for more info)**   \n",
    "\n",
    "**recap of the objectives for the first 6 weeks:**  \n",
    "We aim to broadly cover a wide range of Machine Learning algorithms so that you can: \n",
    "- handle the technical demands of a 100E given some guidance on the right direction to take \n",
    "- can handle a technical job interview and get hired \n",

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data/home) or the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is quite small, so we have also included it inside the `data` folder inside this repo as `data/raw/data.csv`. \n",
