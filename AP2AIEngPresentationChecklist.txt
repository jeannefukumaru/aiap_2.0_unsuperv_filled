Can APs explain the concepts behind proximity matrices and measuring disimilarity between objects? 

Can APs explain the rationale behind how they chose and validated their clusters? 
- view clusters and see whether they correspond to business processes/business trends. 

Did APs handle outliers appropriately, removing them from dendrogram to create a more understandable visualisation? 

Did APs make the necessary tweaks to create an understandable visualisation? (No unintelligible lumps of branches allowed. Trees should be scaled properly). 

Did APs normalise the data as a preprocessing step? 

Did APs understand the concept behind normalisation and the different normalisation techniques available? 

Did APs apply the Silhouette score to choose best number of clusters? 

Did APs use covariance to select informative columns for their GMM model?
